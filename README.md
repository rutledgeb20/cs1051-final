Final project: Price Comparer
by Bryce Rutledge, Elijah Cyr

Our goals for this project were massive, we wanted to create a bot that scanned websites for cerrtain items someone is looking for to gather a price, review,
and create averages among them, and then pick out the best ones, all while writing it to a csv file to write down the findings and have something to look at.

Clearly that was not completed, but we got some of it done. We faced many challenges, we went into this very confident, maybe even a little cocky, and were
humbled quickly. We had problems with installing the libraries needed to do this, had trouble finding the rght libraries for what we want, easier/harder or ones that 
were more tuned for what we had in mind. Then writing the code, and figuring out the syntax with the new libraries, what we could pull from the html, how to be able to 
read the html, and then how iterate over it into lists/dictionaries. This was a problem. For a while it just seemed like we weren't able to get the right html class
names, or the right syntax, or the right parameters. I don't know how many times we tried basically the same code but in different ways to write in the ways that we
we knew how. Learning the syntax of the libraries was incredibly hard and suprised that we even got as far as we did, probably by luck tbh.

We learned quickly that we were not as insane coders that we thought we were, and that what seems easy may actually be really hard. We learned how to install libraries
that aren't in the python libraries naturally. We also learned that the guess and check method may or may not be the best route to figuring out problems in coding, but
sometimes did it work/needed.

We enjoyed doing this whole thing, we really liked that we were able to build whatever we desired and gave us full creativity in doing so. What we accomplished is not
a massive feat for normal coder, but for us we felt like we accomplished a lot, even for so little. I think the most fun thing about this was just checking a bunch 
of websites and reading their html and seeing whether or not the site would allow us it, we did this for hours until we found newegg. It was a pain but it was a blast,
we had a lot of fun, we learned a lot, and overcame challenges. We used prior knowledge of stuff we learned in class, and new knowledge that we had to each ourselves. 
The project was probably our favorite project of school in general so far, and has got us working and researching and beginning our own coding projects. If we can do this
we can do a lot.
