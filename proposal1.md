# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Price Comparing Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This project will compare prices across multiple websites, create an average and give you the website with the lowest price.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Apart from comparing prices from multiple websites and giving the lowest price. It will also include product reviews, and data from forums to create a review analysis of the product. It will be executed through a python bot, from a user input. It will read websites HTML code to get this information. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Atleast be able to read the website for prices. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Be able to read for prices and reviews.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Be able to read for prices and reviews. Also create an average price, give the website of the lowest, and give a review anaylsis. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

How to create a python bot, read HTML with python. How to scan and parse information through python. 
Elijah and I will divide the work and research accordingly.
